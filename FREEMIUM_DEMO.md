## 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

### **Service Architecture**

- Local storage for demo persistence

### **Plan Configuration**

    price: 0,
    features: {
      invoicesPerMonth: 3,
      hasWatermark: true,
      prioritySupport: false
    }
  }
  // ... Pro and Business plans
}
```

### **Usage Enforcement**
```javascript
// Before PDF generation
if (!SubscriptionService.canGenerateInvoice()) {
  const usageInfo = SubscriptionService.getUsageInfo();
  setUploadMessage(`❌ ${usageInfo.message}`);
  setCurrentView('pricing');
  return;
}
```

### **User Behavior Analytics**
