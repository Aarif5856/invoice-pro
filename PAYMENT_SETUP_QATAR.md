payoneerDetails: {
  email: '5856music@gmail.com',
  receiverName: 'Mohamed Aarif Abdul Majeed',
  customerId: '98977720',
  country: 'Qatar'
}

// Your Qatar bank details  
qatarBankDetails: {
  bankName: 'Qatar National Bank (QNB)',
  accountName: 'Mohamed Aarif Abdul Majeed', // Update with your business name if different
  // Add your actual QNB account details when ready
  email: '5856music@gmail.com' // Payment confirmations email
}
```

### 2. Configure Exchange Rates
The service automatically converts USD to QAR using approximate rate (1 USD = 3.64 QAR). Update this in production with real-time rates.

### 3. Manual Payment Verification
Currently set up for manual verification. All payment confirmations are processed manually by checking:
- Bank transfer confirmations
- Payoneer payment notifications
- Crypto transaction hashes

## Subscription Plans
- **Free**: 3 documents/month
- **Pro**: $9.99 USD/month (‚âà 36 QAR)
- **Business**: $19.99 USD/month (‚âà 73 QAR)

## User Flow

2. System shows available payment methods for Qatar
3. User selects preferred payment method
4. System displays specific payment instructions
5. User completes payment and emails confirmation
6. Manual verification activates subscription

## Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: React with inline payment method selection
- **Backend**: PayoneerService handles all payment processing
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics tracks payment events

## Security Considerations
- No sensitive payment data stored locally

- Reference IDs prevent duplicate payments

## Next Steps for Production
1. Connect to real Payoneer API for automated processing
