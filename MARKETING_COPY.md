Launching a SaaS? Here's what I learned building Invoice Pro:

1. **PayPal integration is complex** - Took 3 weeks to get subscriptions working properly
2. **UI/UX matters** - Modern design increases conversion rates by 40%
3. **Accessibility is crucial** - WCAG 2.1 compliance opens up more customers
4. **Mobile-first** - 60% of users access on mobile
5. **Documentation saves time** - Good docs reduce support tickets by 70%

The complete source code is available for developers who want to skip the learning curve.

Title: "Built a complete invoice SaaS with React + PayPal integration - sharing the journey"

Hey r/webdev!

Just finished building Invoice Pro, a professional invoice and receipt generator SaaS. Thought I'd share the technical details and lessons learned.

**Tech Stack:**
- React + Vite for frontend
- PayPal SDK for payments
- jsPDF for PDF generation
- Firebase for data storage
- Vercel for deployment

**Key Features:**
- Multi-step invoice creation
- PayPal subscription management
- Dashboard analytics
- Mobile responsive design
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1)

**Biggest Challenges:**
1. PayPal subscription integration (complex webhook handling)
2. PDF generation with custom styling
3. Responsive design for complex forms
4. State management for multi-step processes

**Results:**
- 6 months of development
- Professional UI/UX
- Ready for deployment
- Comprehensive documentation
